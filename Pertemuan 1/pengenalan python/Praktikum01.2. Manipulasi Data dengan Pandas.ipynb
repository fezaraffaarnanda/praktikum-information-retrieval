Pandas biasa digunakan untuk membuat tabel, mengubah dimensi data, mengecek data, dan lain sebagainya. Struktur data dasar pada Pandas dinamakan DataFrame, yang memudahkan kita untuk membaca sebuah file dengan banyak jenis format seperti file .txt, .csv, dan .tsv. Fitur ini akan menjadikannya table dan juga dapat mengolah suatu data dengan menggunakan operasi seperti join, distinct, group by, agregasi, dan teknik lainnya yang terdapat pada SQL.\n","Pandas serupa dengan dplyr pada bahasa pemrograman R"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":600,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692980794270,"user":{"displayName":"FEZA RAFFA ARNANDA","userId":"03411195041732987258"},"user_tz":-420},"id":"o_HnK0jiOCZ2"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd # load library pandas\n","import numpy as np # load library numpy"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uBiM030KPM81"},"source":["# Struktur Data Pandas\n","\n","Terdapat 3 struktur data pada pandas:\n","\n","- **Series** (1D): struktur data homogen, data value *mutable* dan *size-immutable*\n","- **DataFrame** (2D): struktur data heterogen, tabular, data value *mutable* dan *size-mutable*\n","- **Panels** (3D): struktur data dengan *size-mutable* array\n","\n","The best way to think of these data structures is that the higher dimensional data structure is a container of its lower dimensional data structure.
